I am a graduate student at [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/), majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I earned my bachelor degree from [University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB)](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/), majoring in Automation Engineering and supervised by [Prof. Ling Wang](http://saee.ustb.edu.cn/quantijiaoshi/2015-05-12/40.html). I had a research experience working on Data Mining, Augmented Reality and Computer Vision. I had a few short exchange experiences abroad, in [Queensland University](https://www.uq.edu.au/) (UQ, 2018, Australia) and [National University of Science and Technology](https://en.misis.ru/) (NUST MISIS, 2019, Russia).

My research interests lie in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. Currently I am engaged in reseaching NeRF and 6D Pose Estimation.
